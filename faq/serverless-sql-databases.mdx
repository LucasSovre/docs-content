## How am I billed for Serverless SQL Databases?

You are billed both for the storage used and the compute resources used. You can see the cost estimate in the Database creation wizard.

    - Compute: You are billed based on compute resources (vCPU and RAM) provisioned to handle your workload. Provisionned resources evolves according to [Autoscaling](insert internal link to this FAQ) and stay between the Minimum and Maximum vCPU thresholds you defined for your database. For each vCPU provisioned, 4 GB of RAM will be allocated.

    - Storage: You are billed for the storage consumed by your database. Storage price is based on the size of your database (in GB) and includes 7 days of automated backups with no additional costs. Storage is always billed whether your database is in an active state or idle state.

    <Message type="note">
      You will not be billed if your database is configured with 0 vCPU as a minimum and is in **idle** status.

## What are the differences between Serverless SQL Databases and PostgreSQL databases?

Serverless SQL Database is compatible with most PostgreSQL-compatible clients and tools. Due to connection pooling support, some minor features are disabled or will not work as expected. Check out the [Known differences/Known unsupported commands](insert link) page for more information.

## How many simultaneous connections can my database receive?

Serverless SQL Database handles connection pooling seamlessly. The number of maximum simultaneous connections will scale with CPU and RAM. As an order of magnitude, you can expect XX simultaneous connections support per each GB RAM.
