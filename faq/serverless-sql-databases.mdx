## What features are not supported during the beta?

The following features are currently not supported and will be implemented at a later time:

  - Automatic and manual backups
  - Logs and metrics

## What are the technical specifications of Serverless SQL Databases?

| Specification   | Minimum | Maximum           |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| vCPU            | 0 vCPU  | 16 vCPU           |
| RAM             | 0 GB    | 64 GB (4 GB/vCPU) |
| Storage\*       | 0 GB    | 1 TB              |
| Connections\*\* | 0       | 28                |

\* The maximum storage capacity will increase with upcoming releases.

\*\* The number of maximum connections scales with the allocated vCPUs an RAM.

## How am I billed for Serverless SQL Databases?

You are billed both for the compute resources provisioned and the storage used. You can see the cost estimate in the Database creation wizard.

  - **Compute**: You are billed based on compute resources (vCPU and RAM) provisioned to handle your workload. Provisioned resources evolve according to the [autoscaling](/faq/serverless-sql-databases/#what-is-autoscaling-and-how-does-it-work) parameter and stay between the minimum and maximum thresholds defined for your database. For each vCPU provisioned, 4 GB of RAM will be allocated.

  - **Storage**: You are billed for the storage consumed by your database. Storage price is based on the size of your database (in GB) and includes 7 days of automated backups with no additional costs. Storage is always billed even your database is in an active state or idle state.

  <Message type="note">
    You will not be billed if your database is configured with 0 vCPU as a minimum and is in **idle** status.

## What are the differences between Serverless SQL Databases and PostgreSQL databases?

Serverless SQL Database is compatible with most PostgreSQL-compatible clients and tools. Due to connection pooling support, some minor features are disabled or will not work as expected.

Some PostgreSQL administration commands (called DDL for Data Definition Language) may not be supported. For instance, `CREATE DATABASE` or `CREATE USER` commands are not directly supported, but the actions can be done through the Scaleway console and automated with the CLI, the API or Terraform.

## How many simultaneous connections can my database receive?

Serverless SQL Database handles connection pooling seamlessly. The number of maximum simultaneous connections will scale with CPU and RAM.
 
## What is idle state and how does it work?

After receiving no query for 5 minutes, a Serverless SQL Database will enter into idle state. It switches from **Running** to **Ready to use**.

While your database is in idle state, you will not be billed for compute resources (vCPU and RAM). You will however still be billed for storage resources.

Refer to [How am I billed?](/faq/serverless-sql-databases/#how-am-i-billed-for-serverless-sql-databases) for more information.

## What is autoscaling and how does it work?

Autoscaling triggers automatically based on your database vCPU consumption:

  - **Scaling up**: after using more than a certain percentage of CPU during several minutes, the vCPU and RAM allocated to your database will increase (up to a maximum of 16 vCPUs and 64 GB RAM)

  - **Scaling down**: after consuming less than a certain percentage of CPU during several minutes, the CPU and RAM allocated to your database will decrease (down to a minimum of 1 vCPU and 4 GB RAM while your database is active)

## Is there any latency linked to scaling or cold starts?

Scaling an active database or waking up an idle database will be seamless for clients connected to the database as the connections will be maintained, but queries performed during these operations may experience a few seconds of delay.

You can avoid cold starts by defining a minimum of 1 vCPU or more.
