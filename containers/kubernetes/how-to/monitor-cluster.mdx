  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) 
  - You have [created](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster) a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster
  - You have [activated](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/) your observability Cockpit

Scaleway's observability Cockpit provides automated monitoring of your Kubernetes cluster. As Kubernetes environments grow in complexity, monitoring becomes crucial for optimal performance. Visualization of the clusters' metrics are available in a hosted Grafana.
Grafana's rich visualizations and ease of use make it an ideal choice. Cockpit offers a hassle-free solution, providing real-time insights without extra infrastructure.

[Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/) empowers you to monitor the clusters' control plane, nodes, managed resources and the cluster system applications.
* Detect incidents and diagnose failures in the earliest stages
* Get new insights about control plane and worker nodes usage such as CPU, memory, to optimize your resource allocation
* Achieve a better understanding of your infrastructure by analyzing data on your API server, system applications, up and down scaling behavior

## How to access your Cockpit Grafana dashboard
