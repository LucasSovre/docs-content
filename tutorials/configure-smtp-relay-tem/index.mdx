Installing an [SMTP]() relay that sends messages from your servers allows you to be notified if/when there are problems, as the server tends to report them by email.

This also means that if you have installed software on the server, the software can rely on the relay's SMTP rather than on configurations that are not always easy to handle.


In this tutorial, you will learn how to install postfix and how to send emails via Transactional Email's SMTP.
