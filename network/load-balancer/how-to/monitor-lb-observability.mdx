Scaleway Observability allows you to create a Cockpit from which you can monitor your Load Balancer, and get insights and context into its behavior. You can visualize your Load Balancer's metrics and logs through your Cockpit by setting up a Grafana dashboard.

This page shows you how to set up your Scaleway Cockpit with Grafana to access your Load Balancer's metrics, logs and other monitoring information.

## How to activate your Cockpit

A Cockpit is an instance of the Scaleway Observability product. Each Scaleway [Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#project) can have only one Cockpit.

Activate your Cockpit in two simple steps by following our [dedicated how-to](/observability/cockpit/how-to/activate-cockpit/).

## How to retrieve your Grafana credentials

In order to access your dashboards, you need to add a Grafana user to your Cockpit and generate credentials.

Follow our [documentation](/observability/cockpit/how-to/retrieve-grafana-credentials/) to create and retrieve your Grafana credentials.
